## Introduction to Dart

Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform, often used with the Flutter framework for mobile development. Dart is a strongly-typed, object-oriented language optimized for UI with support for asynchronous programming.

---

## Setting Up Dart

1. **Install Dart SDK**  
   Download the Dart SDK from the official [Dart site](https://dart.dev/get-dart). Verify the installation with:
   ```bash
   dart --version
   ```
2. **Use DartPad**  
   Try Dart code instantly in your browser using [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/).

## Dart Syntax Basics

### Variables and Data Types
```dart
var name = 'John';       // Type inferred
String city = 'Doha';    // Explicit type
final age = 20;          // Constant
const PI = 3.14;         // Compile-time constant
```

### Operators
Dart supports arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, e.g., `+`, `-`, `==`, `&&`.

### Control Flow Statements
**Conditionals and Loops**  
Dart has standard `if`, `else`, and looping structures:
```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print(i);
}
```

---

## Functions in Dart

### Basic Function Definition
```dart
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Arrow Functions
For single-line functions:
```dart
int subtract(int a, int b) => a - b;
```

### Optional and Named Parameters
Dart supports optional and named parameters in function definitions:
```dart
void greet([String? name]) {
  print('Hello, ${name ?? 'Guest'}!');
}
```

---

## Object-Oriented Programming in Dart

### Classes and Objects
```dart
class Car {
  String color;
  Car(this.color);

  void drive() => print('Driving a $color car');
}

Car myCar = Car('red');
myCar.drive();
```

### Inheritance and Mixins
```dart
class ElectricCar extends Car {
  int batteryLevel;
  ElectricCar(String color, this.batteryLevel) : super(color);
}
```

---

## Collections in Dart

Dart has several collection types, including lists, sets, and maps.

### Lists
Ordered collections:
```dart
List<String> fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana'];
```

### Sets
Unordered collections of unique items:
```dart
Set<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
```

### Maps
Key-value pairs:
```dart
Map<String, String> capitals = {'Qatar': 'Doha'};
```

---

## Asynchronous Programming

### Future and Async-Await
Dart handles asynchronous operations using `Future` and `async`/`await`:
```dart
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  return 'Data loaded';
}

void loadData() async {
  String data = await fetchData();
  print(data);
}
```

### Streams
Streams are used to handle continuous data flow:
```dart
Stream<int> countStream = Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (count) => count + 1);
```

---

## Error Handling

Dart uses `try-catch` blocks to handle errors:
```dart
try {
  int result = 10 ~/ 0; // Integer division by zero
} catch (e) {
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

---

## Using Dart for Flutter Development

Dart integrates seamlessly with the Flutter framework, allowing you to build cross-platform mobile applications. Set up Flutter and write Dart code to build widgets, manage UI, and control app logic.
